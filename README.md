# SetupGiveaway

This project works towards a fully functional site, where people can setup giveaways for their business, fans, friends, family or other groups.

It will be build with a ASP.NET 5 Web API as backend and React as frontend.

The initial version will work towards register and join giveaways and then find a winner. Thereafter additional features will be build upon it.
